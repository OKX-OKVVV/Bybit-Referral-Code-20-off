**How to Use a Bybit Referral Code**

Using a Bybit Referral Code ensures your account is linked to a referrer, making you eligible for exclusive bonuses and commissions. To properly apply the code during signup, follow these steps:

1. **[Register for a Bybit account](https://partner.bybit.com/b/64219):** Head to the Bybit website or open the Bybit mobile app, select “Sign Up,” and enter your email, phone number, and password to start.
2. **Input the referral code:** If prompted, type **64219** into the referral field before completing the registration to secure your eligibility for rewards.
3. **Verify your identity if required:** Depending on your region, Bybit may ask you to complete KYC verification to enable full platform access, including withdrawals and advanced trading.
4. **Confirm the code is applied:** After signing up, check your account settings or Rewards Hub to ensure the referral code was successfully registered.
5. **Begin trading and using Bybit’s features:** Once your account is verified, you can deposit funds, execute trades, and take advantage of any referral-related benefits.

**Important:** Referral codes must be entered at signup, as they cannot be applied retroactively. If forgotten, users will not qualify for referral-linked bonuses or commissions.
